# BioAcoustics-Plant-Sounds-Classification
The early detection of plant conditions is a crucial aspect of modern agriculture as it enables 
timely interventions that can significantly enhance crop health and productivity traditional 
methods for identifying plant physiological state typically depend on physical inspections 
or visible symptoms which often fail to provide early warning signs. Recent advancements in 
plant bioacoustics suggests that plants not only respond to external sounds but also emit 
airborne sounds that can convey information about their physiological states. These sounds, 
detectable from meters away in controlled environments, may serve as cues or signals in 
ecological interactions, influencing nearby organisms.   

However, detecting and analysing these sounds in a way that yields actionable information 
remains a complex challenge. In this research we propose a novel approach to plant health 
monitoring by first determining the informational value of these ultrasonic sounds through 
preliminary studies and established that the sounds emitted by plants under stress contain 
patterns that are informative and can serve as indicators of specific conditions building on this 
discovery, we developed a deep learning-based model designed to classify these sounds 
according to both the type of plant and the nature of the stress condition such as dehydration 
or physical cuts. Our model leverages data collected in controlled environments such as 
greenhouses where ultrasonic recording devices capture the emissions. 


Today, understanding plant conditions has become vital for achieving healthy crop growth and 
maximizing agricultural profits. In an era of growing food demand and climate uncertainty, 
accurate monitoring of plant health plays a critical role in ensuring sustainable and efficient 
farming practices. Using deep learning introduces a non-invasive automated system for real 
time monitoring of plant health by categorizing plants sounds into specific stress and damage 
classes. our system allows farmers to quickly identify and address issues minimizing crop loss 
and improving agricultural productivity this innovative use of bioacoustics data and machine 
learning holds promise for transforming plant care practices providing a proactive tool for 
sustainable agriculture.
