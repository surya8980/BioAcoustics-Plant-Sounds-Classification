Recorded Plant Sounds from: Sounds emitted by plants under stress are airborne and informative.
Includes recordings of plant sounds emitted from stressed plants, and sounds from empty environments.


## Description of the data and file structure

Inside the .zip file, there are directories. 
Each directory consists of .wav files that are recordings of sounds according to the directory's name (e.g. Tomato Dry - sounds from tomatoes experiencing a drought stress).
The wav files' names are of the format id_<plant_id>_sound_<sound_id>, were plant_id is an identifier of the plant recorded, and sound_id is an incrementing identifier of the sound recorded per plant_id.
If the recording isn't of a plant (e.g. Empty Pot), the plant_id represents a recording instance.
